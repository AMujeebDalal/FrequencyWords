# FrequencyWords
Repository for Frequency Word List Generator and processed files

In early days I hosted the generated files on OneDrive with my blog https://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/ linking to it.
Moving forward, the code and the generated outputs are on GitHub.

The data used to generate this lists can be found at http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/OpenSubtitles2016.php
